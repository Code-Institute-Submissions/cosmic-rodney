**Cosmic Rodney**
This project is to help create a website for an existing band, Cosmic Rodney, to help build there presence and generate more business for them.
I aquired authorisation to work on the website from the band members. It is designed to be an easy to view/navigate website and not overload the viewer.
Visitors to the site will be able to gain a insight into the band, view pictures from past events and contact the band for bookings. 

**Learnings**
The site has been built using a variety of CSS and Bootstrap html styling to help me obtain a better understand of how bootstrap works. 

**UX**
The website is built as simply as possible to not overload the viewer with information. It will be a site thats easy to navigate and learn.

The Homepage is desgined to have the feel of a Movie Poster and create the theme of the whole website. 

A user of the site will want to see what Cosmic Rodney preform and see examples of this. They will be able to email the band or get in direct contact with them
if they want to book an event via a simple form.

They will also be able, through simple navigation, which is common to them, view the band members and a short bio on them.

The user will not be overloaded with information as they will want a quick, easy to view site on all devices in order to make a decision
on booking the band.

Navigation within the site will be aiming to direct them to their facebook page as this is where most of there business is done at this current time.

The wireframes for this can be seen at this link https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/63484230/cosmic-rodney-basic-wireframes

**FEATURES STILL TO IMPLEMENT:**
The contact us page currently doesn't have an active form. This will be implemented once i have learnt how to do this via my course. 

Part way through the project Gitpod stopped understanding the code being written so it became difficult to read and implement certain aspects. The error
is being investigated by Github at the moment and i will tidy the code after this.
