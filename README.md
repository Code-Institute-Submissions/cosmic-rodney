Cosmic Rodney
This project is to help create a website for an existing band, Cosmic Rodney, to help build there presence and generate more business for them.
I aquired authorisation to work on the website from the band members. It is designed to be an easy to view/navigate website and not overload the viewer.
Visitors to the site will be able to gain a insight into the band, view pictures from past events and contact the band for bookings. 

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

UX
The website is built as simply as possible to not overload the viewer with information. It will be a site thats easy to navigate and learn.

A user of the site will want to see what Cosmic Rodney preform and see examples of this. They will be able to email the band or get in direct contact with them
if they want to book an event via a simple form.

They will also be able through simple navigation, which is common to them, view the band members and a short bio on them.

The user will not be overloaded with information as they will want a quick, easy to view site on all devices in order to make a decision
on booking the band.
