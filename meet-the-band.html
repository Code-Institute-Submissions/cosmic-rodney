					<h2 class="zoom">Ian</h2>
					<p class="band-bio">Front man and lead vocalist Ian is originally from Brighton and has been on the
						Cambridgeshire music scene for about 10 years. An original member of the now defunked
						<em>'Blues Volcano'</em> and a founding member of <em>'Cosmic Rodney'</em>. When he's not
						singing he wishes he was! He's not allowed to play guitar in the band because he hasn't
						practised enough. If he grows up he wants to be a Astronaught. We don't deter him from his lofty
						aspiriation because the chances of him growing up are very slim! A rather drunk man once told
						him he was the best unsigned vocalist in the pub that evening, it was unusually quiet for a band
						night. He sings his heart out at every gig and to this day hasn't missed a note. </p>

						<h2 class="zoom">Dave Tubb</h2>
						<p class="band-bio"> On the drums we have Dave Tubb, his journey to rock stardom has been epic!
							After starring in Miami Vice for almost a decade he accepted a promotion to become Ketton's
							sexiest truck driver, an accolade he still holds to this day. He's been drumming since just
							before he was born and he's been in bands including xxxxxx. He is so excited to get to gigs
							that he often forgets his shoes. He drinks so much water he's had his own meter installed.
							He does not, and will never, undertstand the concept of a short drum solo. If he tells you
							the pizza story then you have made it to the inner-circle. </p>

							<h2 class="zoom">Justin Orlof</h2>
							<p class="band-bio">Justin AKA "J-DOG" is in fact a human of 1972 vintage. A Peterborough
								legend on the guitar and a renowned painter and decorator. He once attached a roller to
								his Stratocaster and decorated an entire house in the style of Hank Marvin. He has been
								in numerous bands including xxxxx. We try and trip him up but to this day have not found
								a tune he can't play. It's hard to believe he once sported a perm!</p>

								<h2 class="zoom">Pete Saunders</h2>
								<p class="band-bio"> On the bass guitar we have His Royal Highness "Lord Pete Saunders".
									Legend of the local music scene and in the Guinness book of records as the world's
									tallest bass player. Pete took up the bass when he realised he was the only man big
									enough to hold it properly. Pete suffers from a rare condition called
									<em>"random birthday disorder"</em> that affects time lords and former drag queens
									(Pete isn't a time lord). He celebrated his 100th birthday twice this year and is
									single handedly responsible for almost all of the U.K's full fat Coke consumption.
									His extraordinary music career includes bands such as xxxxx. In his spare time Pete
									likes to figure out how to get through his front door without banging his head. Pete
									has a unique ability to find items of clothing that only bass players can get away
									with wearing.</p>
